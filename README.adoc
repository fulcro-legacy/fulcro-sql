= Fulcro SQL

This will be a library that can run Om Next graph queries against an SQL database to make it easier to build
data-driven apps that need to use a relational database for the back-end.

== Development

Running tests for development:

1. Start a REPL
2. Run `(test-suite)`
3. Browse to http://localhost:8888/fulcro-spec-server-tests.html

The tests are encoded via fulcro-spec, but are just plain clj tests, so you can run them
however you would normally run clojure tests; however, the output and UI are much better
if you use the web-based rendering.
